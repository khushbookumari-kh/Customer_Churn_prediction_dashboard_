A Churn Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI, based on bank customer data.

Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to analyze customer churn behavior and identify key insights that can help the company reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.

Key Features of the Dashboard:

Churn Rate by Age Groups: Showed how different age groups contribute to overall churn, revealing higher churn among certain age brackets.

Churn Rate by Credit Scores: Helped identify which credit score ranges had higher churn risk.

Customer Segmentation: Used pie and donut charts to visualize:

Gender Distribution

Activity Status (Active/Inactive)

Credit Card Ownership

Country-wise Distribution

Product Preference

Filters & Interactivity:
Implemented slicers and filters to make the dashboard interactive for stakeholders to explore trends across different customer dimensions.

Results & Insights:

Total customers analyzed: 7861

Customers lost: 2033

Overall churn rate: 25.9%

Identified high churn among customers aged 41â€“50 and those with low credit scores.

Actionable insights for retention strategies were derived based on demographic and product usage patterns.

Tools Used:

Power BI
